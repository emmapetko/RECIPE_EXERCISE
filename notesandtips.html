    <h1>Notes and Tips for 20-Minute Honey Garlic Beef</h1>
    <h2>Ingredient Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>I like to use <b>flank steak</b> for this recipe, cut it into strips across the grain. Make sure you use high quality and fresh meat.</p>
        <p>Use <b>freshly grated ginger</b>, it will add amazing flavor to the meal.</p>
        <p>Also, <b>make sure the oil is hot prior to frying.</b> The best way to test if the oil is hot, add a small piece of beef into it. It should sizzle right away. This way you know it’s ready to fry.</p>
        <p>You can use more or less garlic in this recipe, based on your preference.</p>
        <p>Red pepper flakes – you can use more if you would like the meal to be spicier.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have sesame oil on hand, use <b>canola or vegetable oil.</b></p>
        <p>Similarly, if you don’t have hot Chinese mustard on hand, you can skip it.</p>
        <p>Worcestershire sauce will enhance the beef flavor, I recommend using it.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Serving Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>The beef is best served over rice with veggies on the side.</p>
        <p>Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus or bok choy also are great sides.</p>
        <p>Noodles are also a great source of carbs to pair with the beef.</p>
        <p>A nice, fruity red wine such as Zinfandel or Syrah will pair nicely with the flavors in this beef dish.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for a white option, Riesling or Pinot Grigio are always great matches for bold, somewhat spicy dishes.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Storing Notes</h2>
    <p>Fridge: If you have leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container, and properly seal. Then, store in the fridge for up to 4 days. Best to reheat prior to serving.<br> 
    Freezer: Before freezing it, ensure the dish is completely cool. Then, transfer to a freezer-proof dish, and freeze for up to 3 months. </p>
